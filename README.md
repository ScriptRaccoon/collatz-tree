# Collatz DOM tree

When you want to visualize a tree on a website, you can actually create it using the DOM which is built into the browser. After all, the DOM is a tree. The whole styling can be then done with CSS, so that it really looks like a tree.

This is what this little project is about. It creates the Collatz tree (see [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)) using the DOM. You can adjust the height of the tree. But you can also use a checkbox to see how the DOM actually looks like without the extra CSS.
